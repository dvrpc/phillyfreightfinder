    <p><i>PhillyFreightFinder</i> was created primarily as a platform for data. This framework is intended to improve the access to freight facility data throughout the region in order to improve planning, economic development, and public awareness around freight in the Delaware Valley.</p>
    <p>Our data sets have been developed through years of planning studies in the region. In addition, regional private sector and public partners have contributed valuable data related to the appropriate nomenclature of facilities and have evaluated our datasets to further refine the accuracy of <i>PhillyFreightFinder</i>. These partners have also been instrumental in sharing activity data that helps our regional partners to better understand priorities across the Delaware Valley.</p>

                        <p>The DVRPC Freight Highways data layer was based on DVRPC's major routes dataset representing major highways in the region. The dataset uses the centerlines of undivided highway segments and ramps to depict each of the major freight serving highways as identified by DVRPC staff. The highways are limited to regional serving routes including interstates and limited-access highways. This dataset is mapped by route name number and is segmented at key interchanges and by several characteristics: road profile, V/C ratio and performance indicators.</p>

                        <p>National Highway System (NHS) connectors are roads, which may be either state or locally owned, which connect intermodal facilities to major highways on the National Highway System.

These routes were digitized based on DVRPC's street centerline data set to correspond with the officially designated NHS Connector routes.</p>

                    <p>The DVRPC Freight Rail Line data layer was developed to identify key ownership and operation details for freight rail lines in the Delaware Valley. This data set was developed internally using various rail mapping and track chart sources. The polyline network represents rights-of-way rather than track and is segmented based on subdivision or track name as well as key profile details. The line set has been developed with input from various Class I and short-line railroads in the region.</p>
